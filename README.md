# GinyuForce

Welcome to the notebook for our AA Team Assignment project! To ensure structured and effective collaboration, here are some important notes on how to use and handle this notebook.

### Problem Description

This project focuses on helping operators of EV charging hubs optimize their
services and infrastructure. A central challenge is balancing limited charging capacity
with unpredictable user behavior, which is influenced by factors like weather, "range
anxiety" and charging habits. The goals are to provide insights into operational perfor-
mance, identify distinct customer groups based on charging behavior with clustering,
and accurately forecast future utilization with an predictive ML model. By addressing
these challenges, operators can improve planning, enhance customer satisfaction, en-
sure efficient use of their charging infrastructure and extend revenue by enabling new
business cases.

### Usage

#### File structure and Sciebo location

This notebook refers to files and resources that are stored in a central Sciebo folder. At the beginning of each notebook you will find an indication of which file(s) from Sciebo is/are required for the respective task.

Sciebo: https://uni-koeln.sciebo.de/s/B7RIXQi3bXxQFlZ

#### Access to files
Make sure that you have access to the Sciebo folder and that the relevant files are correctly downloaded or linked.
Path details: If you are working locally, please check that the file paths used in the notebook match your environment. For users of cloud solutions, the access path may need to be adjusted.

### Structure for Tasks
Please look at the main branch for final submittion. We have distributed the different tasks into different notebooks:
For some of the notebooks data must be be stored in a data folder to run the notebooks so the 

To run the code the necessary packages have to installed first. For the following notebooks please install these packages:
- 01_Data_Preperation: numpy,pandas,matplotlib, seaborn,warnings and ast
- 02_Visualization_Chargingset: numpy, pandas, datetime, warnings, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- 02_Visualization_Weatherset: numpy, pandas, datetime, warnings, matplotlib, seaborn
- 03_Cluster_Analysis: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
